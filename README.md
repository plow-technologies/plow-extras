===========

packages with mutli-purpose use



Often, when writing libraries a few functions get written over and over.  I am tired of this happening ad-hoc, with no chance to improve them.

So I am making this library, basically if you make a package here it should be really really re-usable.

# No Typeclasses!
# No Types!

+ if it isn't a function it doesn't belong here. 

+  base + 1 , maaaybe 2 packages.
